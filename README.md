# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

We were tasked to provide additional data to management about their expected "silver tsunami" with current employees reaching retirement age. This will enable them to get a clearer picture of where they need to focus their replacements efforts on. Will there be very large specific job titles that will dissappear? Is it all management? Using SQL, we can look at the data and answer those questions.
We were also tasked to find eligible mentorship candidates. This will help the company with the transition when people retire. With these insights, the management has an idea of what the future will look like.

I started this project out by creating an ERD (same one from the modules) of 5 CSV files that were provided for us.
